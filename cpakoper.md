# Building a CloudPak operator

Now I am thinking on how the operator can manage a CloudPak - checking installability, verifying install, checking updates etc; I come up with the following idea: the Operator itself can manage a set of resources (ie called cpmgr or something); I think as of now the cpmgr object should have the properties of: type (CP4I/CP4A/CP4D etc), version and optionally features (array of features);
The cpmgr itself can be written not only in Go but it should be optimized. I am thinking that the type and version would determine the container image that the cpmgr pod would run. That image is the one that is in turn perform lifecycle management (To @gangchen - I know it is not exactly how you would use an operator , but I was thinking this may not be a straight use case anyway).
Now how do we (would be CloudPak installer) interact with the cpmgr - I would think that the cpmgr object  status would reflect it (or maybe another field) - Initial - Installable - Running - UpgradeAvailable etc
Initially I would create a simple MVP that deploy a cpmgr operator that can provision cpmgr pods - which disable scaling .... We can slowly develop the individual lifecycle manager; It maybe a common program with different control files (ie JSON or YAML) that define the CloudPak lifecycle needs: cpu/mem/disk reqmt, check update URL, verification tasks etc etc ....
